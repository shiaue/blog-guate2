        <div class="gh-content gh-canvas">
            <h2 id="bottom-line-up-front">Bottom Line Up Front:</h2><p>My name is Tito and I'm looking to build a team of passionate individuals who want to help me revolutionize education in Guatemala.<br>We're starting with a spring 2019 trip to Guatemala where the focus is improving the education through classes, one-on-one mentorship, and working with teachers in the small town of Patzun. (Potential college spring break trip)<br>Second, I am trying to start a non-profit organization with the mission of revamping education in Latin America.</p><p><strong>A little about me:</strong> I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2017, interned at Yelp and Visa as an engineer, and then decided to take my talents to Patzún, Chimaltenango, Guatemala for a month to teach teens and adults there how to build a website (basic computer science). <a href="http://www.eltontito.me/phase-2/?ref=localhost"><em>For more on that trip please check out this post</em></a><em>, and feel free to read the rest of this blog.</em></p><p>I currently work in the San Francisco Area as a software engineer. My passion in education stems from my realization that education is, in my opinion, the most sustainable form of service. There's an old quote that says:</p><blockquote>Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.</blockquote><p>The modern day version of this would be building a computer lab and providing classes to teach students how to use the laptops.</p><hr><h2 id="trip-updates">Trip Updates:</h2><p><strong>20/01/2019</strong><br>My contacts in Guatemala have scheduled a meeting with the head of education of the city of Patzun! We will see if we can mandate teacher workshops for all the teachers there in hopes of creating a better learning environment for the students.</p><p><strong>29/01/2019</strong><br>There are currently 2 potential projects in the works: <br>1. Working with the Ministry of Education to talk about essentially a policy change<br>2. Targeting a specific school and working to motivate the students and collaborate with the teachers at that school.<br>As both these routes are explored, we will go through with the more feasible option. Furthermore, we want to do something that doesn't require follow-up and can be continued when we leave.</p><p><strong>03/02/2019</strong><br>Option 2 is the way to go. It is not feasible to sit down with government / education officials in the capital city when it isn't even guaranteed that any of our strategies or innovative education ideas will yield results. It is better to work with a school and then if this works out, we can look to branch out to other schools. <br>It will also be much easier to develop relationships when we stick to the same school all week.</p><p><strong>22/02/2019</strong><br>My friend, Damaris, who works at a Guatemalan non-profit is completely on board with our mission and has been the most helpful and supportive throughout this process. We have a target school now and have been gathering as much information as possible about the students and teachers. During the week, the plan is to focus on the teachers. I truly believe that this trip and our mission can only be a catalyst. The teachers are the ones who will be inspiring the students when we leave. The teachers are the ones who also need to be inspired to take action and believe in the power of education. <br>We will be working with teachers to discuss and reflect about the current state of education (both in Patzun and in America),  brainstorm ways to weave new teaching styles into the parts of Guatemalan education that are effective, as well as building relations with these teachers. I hope they will feel comfortable enough to reach out after our trip.<br>We will  sit-in class with students and experience education at this school firsthand. In addition, we will try to introduce some stimulating activities and games to the students (e.g. Apples to apples, rubik's cube, scavenger hunt, sudoku, improv, team building) to get the ball rolling on learning how to problem solve, work together, and think creatively.<br><br>Students: ~50<br>Teachers: 4</p><p><strong>27/02/2019</strong><br>The team met with Damaris via videoconference and we discussed the potential schedule. The teachers are very open to my team teaching classes. We are going to receive a list of classes that we could potentially teach and prepare accordingly. I was pleasantly surprised at how receptive the teachers are to a group of foreigners coming in to teach content. I think their main idea was to observe and see how education is done differently and then brainstorm on how to potentially improve their current methodology.</p><hr><h2 id="current-state-of-patzun-guatemala">Current State of Patzun, Guatemala</h2><p><strong>Education</strong><br>
It breaks my heart to see how little the students know about <em>learning</em>.<br>
High school is merely 3 hours a day (09:00-12:00) and it's culturally inappropriate to question teachers.<br>
I would love to be able to give workshops to teachers to help increase effectiveness and engagement in the classroom without completely disrupting cultural norms.<br>
Students do not know <em>how</em> to learn; my goal is to spark their curiosity and give them the mindset to problem solve and think more critically.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong><br>
There is definitely an interest among the students to learn about technology and how things work.<br>
There are many computer labs in the area that aren't being used at all or not being used to the full potential.<br>
The goal is to potentially partner with these labs to improve the usage of current resources.</p>
<p><strong>English</strong><br>
The <em>lingua franca</em> of the modern day is not being taught well in Patzun.<br>
ESL teachers and bilingual volunteers would be a huge help to this challenge.<br>
Students definitely have the desire to learn but don't have the resources nor the teachers.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2><p><em>If you have any of the following experience, and are interested in potentially going on a trip to Guatemala, please reach out.</em></p><ul>
<li>Educators
<ul>
<li>Teachers, education majors, mentors, or tutors</li>
<li>Anyone who has experience working with education policy, curriculum planning, or education administration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CS / IT Technology / Engineering
<ul>
<li>Students or Professionals</li>
<li>Interest in teaching computer literacy, programming, web / graphics design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non Profit Experience
<ul>
<li>I am starting a non-profit organization to continue this work under.</li>
<li>The mission of the NPO would be education improvement in Guatemala (and potentially other Latin American countries).</li>
<li>This would allow for the opportunity to partner with companies and other groups more seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spanish Speakers
<ul>
<li>The better we can communicate our mission and how we are trying to help, the more seamlessly it will be.</li>
<li>The last thing I'd like is to run into the language barrier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, I want our mindset and posture to be simply put, full of grace and humility. We are simply asking the Guatemalans, "Help us help you and let's work together as a team to improve the education in your town". We are not coming in as saviors or know-it-alls, but simply as people who want to be a resource. Like a well, we're just here to overflow their cups 🙏</p><h2 id="contact">Contact</h2><p>agape.aprendizaje@gmail.com  <br>SMS: 262-864-1449</p><hr>
