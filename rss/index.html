I know God&apos;s love has no bounds and He works through language barriers, but it was still difficult for me. The selfish part of me wanted to be more &quot;useful&quot;. The part of me that trusts God fully knows that &quot;it isn&apos;t about me&quot;. Serving with this ministry isn&apos;t about my feelings and my utility. I believe it&apos;s about humbly responding to God&apos;s calling, picking up the phone without an attitude, and abiding in who He says I am. </li><li>Visiting the elderly in hospice, remote homes, and retirement homes really touched me because I don&apos;t usually interact with the elderly. Their stories, tears, and worn eyes gave me a genuine glimpse of Taiwanese history.<br><em>It ought to teach you how to turn your mourning into dancing, your sadness into joy, and your sorrow into laughter. I am glad I was able to be a part of their stories.</em></li><li>My favorite activity in Heng Chun was the indigenous school program that sang and danced for us. I really connected with those students and I hope I can return to that school.</li><li>One of the biggest challenge of this week was not knowing and preparing for what we would do. It wasn&apos;t very clear to me how different all the activities were until we did them all.</li><li>I didn&apos;t know the mission of the second week. If the mission is relational evangelism, I think that picking one activity and doing it all week would allow us to serve a specific need of the community as well as love a specific group of people enough for them to see Jesus. If the mission is education, I think the TAs could prepare to be better suited to educate on the chosen topic (oral cancer, hygiene, ALDH2). I think better communication of the plan, mission, and expectations for this week would have been invaluable for the team.</li><li>I personally learned about Taiwanese culture in ways that I wouldn&apos;t have any other way. I really appreciated the opportunity to connect with the Mackay students on this week and I hope the trip continues to allow that opportunity. Engaging with the elderly and children also gave me another opportunity to understand Taiwan more. From the indigenous school to the remote home visits, I am humbled and grateful to be a part of this experience.</li></ol><p></p><h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3><ol><li>God is Love. Love can involve leaving the home country, learning a new language, working late nights, not seeing loved ones for months, saving every penny, and above all it requires faith.</li><li>It will be easier to connect to some believers than others and it is not a function of how much faith one has.</li><li>Language barriers are like the Great Wall of China: built so people can&apos;t scale them, but sometimes it&apos;s ok to just enjoy the view from distance.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Phase 4: Next Steps]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>How can we further support / serve this community?<br>With a software and mechanical engineer leading this trip, how can we utilize the unique skillsets that come with engineering?<br>Do we need more teachers / education professionals?<br>Do we need more support in Guatemala?</p><h3 id="education-goals">Education Goals</h3><ul><li>Increase student motivation, develop an appetite</li></ul>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/phase-4/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65e8f935c29aeda5523cd0b9</guid><category><![CDATA[Planning]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tito]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 05:33:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can we further support / serve this community?<br>With a software and mechanical engineer leading this trip, how can we utilize the unique skillsets that come with engineering?<br>Do we need more teachers / education professionals?<br>Do we need more support in Guatemala?</p><h3 id="education-goals">Education Goals</h3><ul><li>Increase student motivation, develop an appetite for learning.</li><li>Provide more ways to access educational resources</li><li>Expose students to different career options</li><li>Better support the NPO and teachers</li></ul><hr><h2 id="current-state-of-patz-n-guatemala">Current State of Patz&#xFA;n, Guatemala</h2><h3 id="nufed-escuela-de-alternancia-">NUFED (Escuela de Alternancia)</h3><p><em>The school that we observed and worked with in <a href="http://www.eltontito.me/phase-3/?ref=localhost">Phase 3</a>.</em><br>Students are ages 12-18. There are ~50 students at this school. Currently there are &#xA0;3 &quot;grades&quot; being taught there. <br>There are 2 groups of students at this school. The first group consists of two grades and the second group consists of one grade. While the first group is in class, the other group is working a job and vice versa. Each month, both groups will work for half the month and attend classes for the other half.<br>The 4 full-time teachers and volunteers keep this school going. The whole team is passionate about bringing education to these students. From observation, the curriculum could really be revamped to better target the learning style and ability of the students. With a shortage of staff, the school didn&apos;t even seem to have a curriculum or lesson plan, tests were a group activity, and curiosity had limited space to roam free.</p><h3 id="fundated">Fundated</h3><p><em>This is the NPO that we partnered with and connected us to NUFED</em><br>There is a lot of potential with this partnership. Our main contact is a gritty, kind, passionate, intelligent hard worker. She is willing to listen and collaborate with us to continue supporting the education of these students. This is also the most promising way to ensure that work we do there can be sustained and continued. There is a physical building and a team of 5 + some volunteers year round.</p><h3 id="asociaci-n-vida-clinic">Asociaci&#xF3;n Vida Clinic</h3><p><em>The clinic that I first taught tech classes in. </em><a href="http://www.eltontito.me/phase-2/?ref=localhost"><em>(Phase 2)</em></a><em> This clinic also operates a pharmacy and a water treatment plant in the same building.</em><br>This relationship is not the most stable at the moment. The main doctor and Willow Creek Church have halted their partnership (Willow Creek connected me with them to begin with). This clinic has a lot of influence in Patz&#xFA;n and could be useful to work with them in the future to promote our educational initiatives. They have worked with several American volunteers in the past. This could be an unique internship option for students (in Patzun) to learn about medicine, pharmacy, &#xA0;business, accounting, or water treatment.</p><h2 id="peace-corps-in-patzun-">Peace Corps (in Patzun)</h2><p><em>There are multiple Peace Corps initiatives ongoing in Patzun.</em><br>We have contacts on the education and medical projects in Patz&#xFA;n. Given that these projects are usually ~2 years, these contacts would be able help continue our efforts. (Especially if they intersect with the projects that they are doing as well)</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-next-ideas-">What&apos;s Next? (Ideas)</h2><h3 id="fundated-computer-lab-maker-space">FUNDATED Computer Lab / Maker Space</h3><p>The idea is to build a computer lab in FUNDATED for students who want to continue learning on their own time or work on homework with internet resources.<br>Incentives for students could be implemented. (e.g. earning computer time with projects, interning as a lab manager to manage the lab)<br>Internet based learning is an option (depending on internet connectivity there)<br></p><p>Resources Required:</p><ul><li>Laptops (we already have enough to build a lab)</li><li>Peripherals (mice, keyboards)</li><li>Power Strips</li><li>Tables</li><li>Chairs</li><li><em>Internet?</em></li><li><em>Local server (host files and connect all laptops)</em></li></ul><p></p><h3 id="scholarship-program-financial-support-">Scholarship Program (Financial Support)</h3><p>Creating a scholarship program to incentivise students to work hard. Give them the opportunity to apply and prepare for the program. Potentially send them to Guatemala City to intern with another organization.<br>Even if we had donors, we don&apos;t have a financial plan. How can we use financial resources to better support FUNDATED, which would then be able to better support the surrounding schools?</p><h3 id="teacher-workshops-resources">Teacher Workshops / Resources</h3><p>Leveling up the teachers at this school is a priority. This could be in the form of workshops, preparing curriculums for them, or something else. We provided laptops to the teachers last trip and hopefully those have been easy to integrate into their lives and workflows.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Phase 3: Educational Foundation]]></title><description><![CDATA[BLUF: I'm looking to build a team of passionate individuals who want to help me revolutionize education in Guatemala.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/phase-3/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65e8f935c29aeda5523cd0af</guid><category><![CDATA[Planning]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tito]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 09:13:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589783500222-4529ddfd87d1?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fGd1YXRlbWFsYXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MDk3NzIxNzR8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="bottom-line-up-front">Bottom Line Up Front:</h2><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589783500222-4529ddfd87d1?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fGd1YXRlbWFsYXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MDk3NzIxNzR8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Phase 3: Educational Foundation"><p>My name is Tito and I&apos;m looking to build a team of passionate individuals who want to help me revolutionize education in Guatemala.<br>We&apos;re starting with a spring 2019 trip to Guatemala where the focus is improving the education through classes, one-on-one mentorship, and working with teachers in the small town of Patzun. (Potential college spring break trip)<br>Second, I am trying to start a non-profit organization with the mission of revamping education in Latin America.</p><p><strong>A little about me:</strong> I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2017, interned at Yelp and Visa as an engineer, and then decided to take my talents to Patz&#xFA;n, Chimaltenango, Guatemala for a month to teach teens and adults there how to build a website (basic computer science). <a href="http://www.eltontito.me/phase-2/?ref=localhost"><em>For more on that trip please check out this post</em></a><em>, and feel free to read the rest of this blog.</em></p><p>I currently work in the San Francisco Area as a software engineer. My passion in education stems from my realization that education is, in my opinion, the most sustainable form of service. There&apos;s an old quote that says:</p><blockquote>Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.</blockquote><p>The modern day version of this would be building a computer lab and providing classes to teach students how to use the laptops.</p><hr><h2 id="trip-updates">Trip Updates:</h2><p><strong>20/01/2019</strong><br>My contacts in Guatemala have scheduled a meeting with the head of education of the city of Patzun! We will see if we can mandate teacher workshops for all the teachers there in hopes of creating a better learning environment for the students.</p><p><strong>29/01/2019</strong><br>There are currently 2 potential projects in the works: <br>1. Working with the Ministry of Education to talk about essentially a policy change<br>2. Targeting a specific school and working to motivate the students and collaborate with the teachers at that school.<br>As both these routes are explored, we will go through with the more feasible option. Furthermore, we want to do something that doesn&apos;t require follow-up and can be continued when we leave.</p><p><strong>03/02/2019</strong><br>Option 2 is the way to go. It is not feasible to sit down with government / education officials in the capital city when it isn&apos;t even guaranteed that any of our strategies or innovative education ideas will yield results. It is better to work with a school and then if this works out, we can look to branch out to other schools. <br>It will also be much easier to develop relationships when we stick to the same school all week.</p><p><strong>22/02/2019</strong><br>My friend, Damaris, who works at a Guatemalan non-profit is completely on board with our mission and has been the most helpful and supportive throughout this process. We have a target school now and have been gathering as much information as possible about the students and teachers. During the week, the plan is to focus on the teachers. I truly believe that this trip and our mission can only be a catalyst. The teachers are the ones who will be inspiring the students when we leave. The teachers are the ones who also need to be inspired to take action and believe in the power of education. <br>We will be working with teachers to discuss and reflect about the current state of education (both in Patzun and in America),  brainstorm ways to weave new teaching styles into the parts of Guatemalan education that are effective, as well as building relations with these teachers. I hope they will feel comfortable enough to reach out after our trip.<br>We will  sit-in class with students and experience education at this school firsthand. In addition, we will try to introduce some stimulating activities and games to the students (e.g. Apples to apples, rubik&apos;s cube, scavenger hunt, sudoku, improv, team building) to get the ball rolling on learning how to problem solve, work together, and think creatively.<br><br>Students: ~50<br>Teachers: 4</p><p><strong>27/02/2019</strong><br>The team met with Damaris via videoconference and we discussed the potential schedule. The teachers are very open to my team teaching classes. We are going to receive a list of classes that we could potentially teach and prepare accordingly. I was pleasantly surprised at how receptive the teachers are to a group of foreigners coming in to teach content. I think their main idea was to observe and see how education is done differently and then brainstorm on how to potentially improve their current methodology.</p><hr><h2 id="current-state-of-patzun-guatemala">Current State of Patzun, Guatemala</h2><p><strong>Education</strong><br>
It breaks my heart to see how little the students know about <em>learning</em>.<br>
High school is merely 3 hours a day (09:00-12:00) and it&apos;s culturally inappropriate to question teachers.<br>
I would love to be able to give workshops to teachers to help increase effectiveness and engagement in the classroom without completely disrupting cultural norms.<br>
Students do not know <em>how</em> to learn; my goal is to spark their curiosity and give them the mindset to problem solve and think more critically.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong><br>
There is definitely an interest among the students to learn about technology and how things work.<br>
There are many computer labs in the area that aren&apos;t being used at all or not being used to the full potential.<br>
The goal is to potentially partner with these labs to improve the usage of current resources.</p>
<p><strong>English</strong><br>
The <em>lingua franca</em> of the modern day is not being taught well in Patzun.<br>
ESL teachers and bilingual volunteers would be a huge help to this challenge.<br>
Students definitely have the desire to learn but don&apos;t have the resources nor the teachers.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2><p><em>If you have any of the following experience, and are interested in potentially going on a trip to Guatemala, please reach out.</em></p><ul>

<p>At the end of the day, I want our mindset and posture to be simply put, full of grace and humility. We are simply asking the Guatemalans, &quot;Help us help you and let&apos;s work together as a team to improve the education in your town&quot;. We are not coming in as saviors or know-it-alls, but simply as people who want to be a resource.

After my limited and broken Spanish failed me when I served as a student in Costa Rica (2013), I realized the importance of spoken languages to communicate, to love, and to more effectively serve others. Furthermore, I <strong>LOVE</strong> Spanish and I have spoken or messaged in Spanish nearly every day for the past few years. (I even convinced some homies to message with me in Spanish on Whatsapp &#x1F601;) My favorite Spanish TV shows are &quot;Casa de Papeles&quot; and &quot;La Ni&#xF1;a&quot;. I have been very intentional about practicing to the point where I convinced my roommates last year to only speak Spanish when we were in our living room. I love the music, the culture, the dance.

In fact, I want to live outside my comfort zone to the point where comfort becomes a foreign to me. I don&#x2019;t say this just because I love challenges, but because Jesus is the only true comfort in life. Nothing else has eternal value.</li><li>After years of studying technology and helping my friends and family with tech problems, I will finally have a way to take what I learned to serve others directly.

The medical clinic could use my assistance and I was able to learn about the technology education, or lack thereof, in Guatemala.</p><h3 id="the-mission">The Mission</h3><p><strong>Teach</strong>: I am partnering with local organizations to create a computer lab with the goal to bringing over 30 laptops (Donated from local organizations and friends) for students. As much as I would love to teach Guatemalan students directly, I believe it would be more effective and sustainable to teach Guatemalan teachers and professors. This will allow for consistent communication and minimize the risk for the teaching to be lost as students become adults. My goal is to teach the professors how to maintain the laptops as well as developing a curriculum that makes it easy for Guatemalan students to learn but also challenges them to learn more like the American college system did for me.</p><p>There currently aren&apos;t any working computer science education opportunities for the students in Guatemala.<br>The government has a weekly program that is expensive and only provides students with 30-60min of computer time once a week!<br>(No one can learn from so little computer time)</p><p>The premise behind this mission is to expose the Guatemalan students to programming and give them the opportunity and resources to learn. (Just like I was given in college)</p><p><strong>Serve</strong>: I will implement a cloud based solution to synchronize patient records at the the medical clinic. Currently, there is nothing to connect the patient data from the clinic, laboratory, and pharmacy. I am hoping to use their internet and a software solution to connect the patient database.<br>Also, I will also help translate for the Willow Creek Family Mission trip that will be there at the same time.</p><p><strong>Love</strong>: When I am not teaching or working at the clinic, I will do everything I can to find extravagant ways to love the Guatemalans from the church community to my host family and evenyone in between. Again, Bob Goff says it best, &quot;When we are fearlessly engaging with world with a child-like faith, it gives those around us the green light to do so too.&quot;</p><h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3><p>To avoid the possibility of taxes, tariffs, confiscation, suspicion, or questioning from the Guatemalan customs (all possible outcomes from bringing one luggage full of laptops across international borders)</p><p>The plan is to distribute these laptops among the family mission trip members to get them across the border. An adult bringing 1-2 laptops shouldn&apos;t raise any eyebrows.</p><p>Once in Guatemala, laptops will be configured for their purpose.<br><strong>This trip kicks off on June 18, 2018.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sprints]]></title><description><![CDATA[<blockquote>Here&apos;s a template to help you get started planning your sprints &#x1F929;&#x1F913;</blockquote><p><strong>What is a Sprint? </strong>A sprint is a focused dash towards the completion of the immediate goals.

First steps.</p><p>At the last minute, my partner told me that we weren&apos;t using the course video resources that I spent hours preparing. So as the class rolled in, I just winged it. Improv teaching... in Spanish. All my preparations became irrelevant and we just dived in.</p><p>We started off with introductions hoping to get the students comfortable. I also asked my partner to talk about &quot;ground rules&quot; for class:</p><ol><li>Ask questions as soon as you have any problems or confusions</li><li>Be honest</li><li>Be creative</li><li>Be motivated</li><li>Participate</li><li>Work together</li></ol><p>From what I understand, my partner and I are going to use this class as trial run for the class with all teachers.</p><h2 id="class-review">Class Review</h2><p>Wow... this was tough. I scrambled and quickly found some basic HTML example pages online and showed the class &quot;what exactly HTML is&quot;. We started off with a basic HTML page with no styling and the majority of the class just copied &quot;code&quot; line by line (I personally don&apos;t even consider working with html - &quot;coding&quot;). Then we walked through basic elements of HTML and showed them how to open a file with Notepad++ and get started from scratch.</p><p>The shyness was palpable and I went around to the students individually to ask if they needed individual assistance.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/07/DSC06352.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Education" loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/07/DSC06343.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Education" loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/07/DSC06401.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Education" loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/07/DSC06385.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Education" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Some definitely have the desire to learn and dive in to this, but the cultural shyness was very hard to break through. I found some students that learned very fast and were bored and I had to come by their computer to give them more challenges. I found a student who was 21 and already had web programming experience and also had 2 laptops. He&apos;s definitely going to be teaching classes when I leave.</p><p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br>Some computers were still in English (couldn&apos;t change OS display language) or had Spanish keyboard settings on a US physical keyboard laptop (this made it hard to type &quot;&lt;&gt;/&quot; characters which were crucial to HTML).</p><p>Students are great at copying, that&apos;s the majority of their education here in Patzun. (Copy what&apos;s on the board and don&apos;t ask questions; read more on Guatemalan education later)</p><p>To prevent so much copying, the example files should all be on the computer. Also HTML / CSS guides in spanish for them to copy onto a USB and take home would be helpful as well. <em>Maybe in the future, create a local network for all the computers to connect to and then have them pull files from the server.</em></p><p>We need a way to gauge the level of technology literacy with the students. Maybe a pretest or something. Some of them didn&apos;t know how to open a file on the desktop. And some of them have seen HTML before.</p><p><strong>Current State of Guatemalan Education: </strong><br>Teachers know everything so the students are expected to just show up and shut up. Raising hands in class is shunned as it&apos;s embarrassing if you don&apos;t know anything so no one talks. There doesn&apos;t seem to be many challenges in school and from grade school to high school the classes only go half the day. It&apos;s called &quot;tipo banco&quot; meaning it&apos;s like a bank transaction, you go to the bank because they have something you don&apos;t, money. Students don&apos;t have conversations / dialogue with teachers nor ask questions. They don&apos;t actively participate in their learning process and that&apos;s something I hope this class helps them change. To take learning into their own hands. Males having female friends and vice versa are also very uncommon. In my class all the guys sat on one side of the table and the girls on the other. Crazy.</p><p><strong>Student Feedback:</strong> At the end of class we asked the class to verbally share what they learned or any feedback for us to improve. <br>The class was dead silent. (It&apos;s going to take a lot to combat the Guatemalan cultural urge to stay quiet) But best thing that happened all class was when we asked the students to create a basic HTML page with their comments. What they liked / didn&apos;t like; what worked / what didn&apos;t; We asked for any constructive criticism to help us improve for the next class. It was crazy to read (and translate) some of the feedback from the students (some who came in with ZERO web dev experience).</p><ol><li>I liked the way the class was taught. I liked the first exercise (copying HTML, and then trying to copy the format of another one). For me this was all new to me and i am thankful for the provided tools, especially Notepad++</li><li>I enjoyed the way it was explained (looking at example, copy, then try challenge). It wasn&#x2019;t too hard for me and i already remembered something that I had seen previously. I learned new commands that I hadn&#x2019;t used before. I could understand what each elements purpose was, although it was explained pretty fast. It was tough for me to copy the example because it was in English (we told them many times they didn&#x2019;t need to copy the example HTML word for word &#x1F602;)</li><li>The class should be slower, so the whole class learns and understands the content better. It&#x2019;s necessary to do exercises to practice what we learned. Keep asking us questions about any doubts or problems we have.</li><li>I liked the way that you taught us, part of it was watching what each tag did and then you helped us resolve any doubts/problems we had. You should review each student&apos;s work after each section to see how they are doing and what points they should focus on more individually. (what a selfless comment, WOW)</li><li>I have never learned this way / methodology before (lesson, example, hands-on exercise). It was difficult for me because I have never seen anything like this before, but little by little I am going to learn and understand.</li></ol><h2 id="-">&#x1F64F;</h2><ol><li>Still have some bacterial stomach infection. Need to push through and hope for the best.</li><li>Pray that we get enough teachers for the next part of the class.</li><li>There is so much potential here and I pray that God can use me to help cultivate it. The interest is here, the passion to learn is here, they don&apos;t have classes afternoon and now the resources (laptops and internet) are here for them too.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Love]]></title><description><![CDATA[Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

I believe what comes out when we are pressed reveals who we truly are.</em></p><h2 id="here-are-the-deets-on-my-host-family-">Here are the deets on my host family.</h2><p>Luiza (let&apos;s call her &quot;grandma&quot;)<br>Glenda (&quot;mom&quot;)<br>Aura (&quot;aunt&quot;)<br>Daniel (&quot;son&quot;)</p><p>Luiza&apos;s sister, who passed away, had 2 daughters (Glenda and Aura). Glenda has one son Daniel. Glenda&apos;s husband was an abusive alcoholic that passed away (not sure on how exactly). So technically she&apos;s the grandaunt of Daniel.</p><p>Aura and Glenda both work in the capital (Guatemala City) one of the most dangerous cities in Latin America. They have a group of 5 that sticks together, looks out for each other, and loves each other as they make the daily 03:00 commute to Guatemala City. These five warriors basically go into a war zone every day just to make it, just to survive. The commute is dangerous as buses are held up at gunpoint and and resistors are usually shot / killed without justice being served. Glenda and Aura have been mugged many times before and have learned to just give up whatever they had on them. They don&apos;t carry smartphones or a lot of money on them so if a bus is held up they have nothing to lose. The commute is unlike America because you can&apos;t sleep or even rest... you are always on the lookout for threats and shooters. Aura and Glenda return home to Patzun around 20:00 absolutely spent.</p><p>Daniel... Oh Daniel. The poor boy has no discipline or respect because his aunt and mother are rarely home. Luiza is burnt out, elderly, and tired of dealing with Daniel&#x2019;s disrespect. Because no one is at home to discipline Daniel, he runs amok and has no self-control. Especially since he grew up with an abusive father, he seeks attention from anyone who can give it to him. He&apos;s too young to understand the loving sacrifices that his mother and aunt make on his behalf and just wants someone to play with.</p><p>Glenda sacrifices time with Daniel and being a part of his upbringing to put food on the table and allow Daniel to buy whatever clothes and toys he needs.</p><p><strong>Ultimatums:</strong> No work available in Patzun; employment opportunities are available &#xA0;in the dangerous capital city. Higher education is very expensive and only high quality in the capital city and maybe Chimaltenango; there is no guarantee that you will be able to find specialized work with a degree afterwards, so why bother paying for school.</p><p>I give up warm showers for Lent... yet here they warm up water on an echo stove (like the ones we built in Poaquil) just to put it in a bucket for me to shower with. I feel like an alien in a different world, but I am doing my absolute best to put myself in the shoes of those here in Patzun.</p><h2 id="-"> &#x1F64F;</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>Pray for Daniel... he needs an outlet for his energy. If he doesn&apos;t improve his attitude and self control and respect for his caretakers... glenda and aura and luiza may be in big trouble. I pray that he slowly begins to understand the love that his mother and aunt and grand aunt have for him.</li>
<li>Pray for my health. I have some stomach infection that should go away in 5 days. I feel fine... My stool is still a 6 on the Bristol and I don&apos;t have stomach pain.</li>
<li>Pray for allergies to stay away for the rest of my time here.</li>
<li>Pray for the teachers and students here to ignite a technology revolution. I am doing everything I can to make the most of my time here.</li>
<li>Pray for my knee.. Haven&apos;t been doing much PT at all, but I&apos;m going to be more intentional about stretching every morning and night. No mobility problems or pain so far.</li>

I needed to ask the 6 year-old boy how to &#x201C;flush&#x201D; the toilet.<br>He goes &#x201C;oh you just pour this other bucket of water into the toilet... if you needed help using the bathroom, just ask&#x201D;<br><br>I then texted Deb, Melissa, and Sarah for advice on my current situation...<br>I was extremely blessed by the number of parents (especially the mothers, you know who you are) that were on the family mission trip as they &#xA0;literally flocked to the sick / weak and offered a million different medications and solutions to help alleviate the suffering.</p><p><br>It dawned on me that I ran out of &quot;drinkable&quot; water and the host family I stayed with didn&#x2019;t get water from Associacion Vida and so my best bet was to get water from the local store. Thankfully the &#x201C;house&#x201D; I was staying at (the majority of the house is outside) was basically attached to the back of a store.<br><br>I knock on the backdoor of the store; they open and I ask for water; I then proceed to enter the little store (behind the counter because this is a street facing store with a small gap for customers to exchange money for products) and it&#x2019;s literally just me and the 2 employees (male and female) in the area of the store where typically only employees stand.<br><br>The male looks at me like I&apos;m crazy ... because I&#x2019;m a Spanish speaking Asian who looks fresh off the boat with American style clothes and 2 empty water bottles asking to buy their biggest container of water.<br><br>They show me a 600ml and a 650ml and I calculate which one is cheaper per mL (frugal as always) and ask for 6 bottles of the cheaper one.<br>Less than $2 for 6 bottles.<br>I then proceed to swallowing as many healthy meds as I can (to a safe extent)<br><br>Dinner is in a kitchen that&#x2019;s using an echo stove.<br>I&#x2019;m pretty sure I ate a few ants in my dinner because they just crawled in my food.. oh well<br>This is the real Guatemalan experience...<br>As raw as it gets.<br></p><hr><h2 id="as-for-the-computers-">As for the computers... </h2><p>Axel, his tech team, and I discussed and prayed over the potential ideas and use cases for these computers.</p><p>We have the computers and the resources and the desire to teach.

I feel warmed up to the country and all I see is green lights for my teaching mission. This cover photo is the church that brought the community together. Our service was at homes that were all somewhat near this church. We ate our lunches, shared purell, laughed, cried, and celebrated in that church this week. The second floor of the church was basically a cliff. There was live electrical wires strung across the top. Stray dogs and insects came in and out of the church like a revolving door. There were no locks, or even doors for that matter. While this church was everything but &quot;comfortable&quot; for American standards, it was literally called <strong>&quot;Church of the God of living water&quot;</strong>. This church was everything for the community. It was their comfort.</p><hr><h2 id="what-is-comfort-why-do-i-crave-comfort">What is comfort? Why do I crave comfort?</h2><p>I&apos;ve been wrestling with these questions this week as I finished working alongside Willow Creek&apos;s family mission trip. </p><p>I ask myself:</p><blockquote>Why do we freak out when we see spiders indoors / outdoors?</blockquote><blockquote>Why do we need to have clean bathrooms, big beds, and warm showers?</blockquote><p>I hate how comfort and familiarity walk hand in hand. I find so much comfort in the familiar to the point where I think I deserve it. I hate how my body is conditioned to crave comfort... I hate how my skin yearns for 105&#xB0; F showers... I think to myself: &quot;I don&apos;t deserve this luxury... My first thought shouldn&apos;t be that the water is cold, it should be &apos;THANK GOD I HAVE CLEAN WATER&apos;&quot;</p><p>Is comfort an illusion; Simply a lie that I tell myself so much that I become accustomed to it? </p><p>Maybe...</p><p>Or maybe I&apos;m just trying to shock my body with discomfort and the unfamiliar to the point where something raw awakens in me? Or maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W1KT8xXaN8&amp;ref=localhost">Andy Mineo is right...</a></p><blockquote>So if you wanna live a comfortable life<br>Make sure you never love nobody, be selfish and never sacrifice</blockquote><p>Maybe there&apos;s a reason that nothing on this earth can truly satisfy and comfort us... God and those that reflect God are the only things that comfort. </p><blockquote>Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. - Psalm 23:4</blockquote><p>These thoughts are raw and pretty unfiltered / unorganized so maybe this is what comes to mind when I&apos;ve been humbled once again by the global reach of God&apos;s love... or maybe I feel like I don&apos;t deserve to have the American luxuries. I don&apos;t know</p><p>-Tito</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Phase 1: High School Mission Trip]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="guatemala-phase-1">Guatemala Phase 1</h2><h4 id="objective-">Objective:</h4><ol><li>FTK - <em>(for the kids / for the kingdom)</em> Lead the high schoolers well.
