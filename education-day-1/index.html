        <blockquote>"Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn." <br>-Benjamin Franklin</blockquote><p>Today was the first day of classes- part of me was disappointed my Guatemalan partner didn't get a group of students/teachers together in time for classes on Monday or Tuesday…but either way, we’re here.<br>Ground zero. First steps.</p><p>At the last minute, my partner told me that we weren't using the course video resources that I spent hours preparing. So as the class rolled in, I just winged it. Improv teaching... in Spanish. All my preparations became irrelevant and we just dived in.</p><p>We started off with introductions hoping to get the students comfortable. I also asked my partner to talk about "ground rules" for class:</p><ol><li>Ask questions as soon as you have any problems or confusions</li><li>Be honest</li><li>Be creative</li><li>Be motivated</li><li>Participate</li><li>Work together</li></ol><p>From what I understand, my partner and I are going to use this class as trial run for the class with all teachers.</p><h2 id="class-review">Class Review</h2><p>Wow... this was tough. I scrambled and quickly found some basic HTML example pages online and showed the class "what exactly HTML is". We started off with a basic HTML page with no styling and the majority of the class just copied "code" line by line (I personally don't even consider working with html - "coding"). Then we walked through basic elements of HTML and showed them how to open a file with Notepad++ and get started from scratch.</p><p>The shyness was palpable and I went around to the students individually to ask if they needed individual assistance.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/07/DSC06352.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/07/DSC06343.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/07/DSC06401.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/07/DSC06385.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Some definitely have the desire to learn and dive in to this, but the cultural shyness was very hard to break through. I found some students that learned very fast and were bored and I had to come by their computer to give them more challenges. I found a student who was 21 and already had web programming experience and also had 2 laptops. He's definitely going to be teaching classes when I leave.</p><p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br>Some computers were still in English (couldn't change OS display language) or had Spanish keyboard settings on a US physical keyboard laptop (this made it hard to type "&lt;&gt;/" characters which were crucial to HTML).</p><p>Students are great at copying, that's the majority of their education here in Patzun. (Copy what's on the board and don't ask questions; read more on Guatemalan education later)</p><p>To prevent so much copying, the example files should all be on the computer. Also HTML / CSS guides in spanish for them to copy onto a USB and take home would be helpful as well. <em>Maybe in the future, create a local network for all the computers to connect to and then have them pull files from the server.</em></p><p>We need a way to gauge the level of technology literacy with the students. Maybe a pretest or something. Some of them didn't know how to open a file on the desktop. And some of them have seen HTML before.</p><p><strong>Current State of Guatemalan Education: </strong><br>Teachers know everything so the students are expected to just show up and shut up. Raising hands in class is shunned as it's embarrassing if you don't know anything so no one talks. There doesn't seem to be many challenges in school and from grade school to high school the classes only go half the day. It's called "tipo banco" meaning it's like a bank transaction, you go to the bank because they have something you don't, money. Students don't have conversations / dialogue with teachers nor ask questions. They don't actively participate in their learning process and that's something I hope this class helps them change. To take learning into their own hands. Males having female friends and vice versa are also very uncommon. In my class all the guys sat on one side of the table and the girls on the other. Crazy.</p><p><strong>Student Feedback:</strong> At the end of class we asked the class to verbally share what they learned or any feedback for us to improve. <br>The class was dead silent. (It's going to take a lot to combat the Guatemalan cultural urge to stay quiet) But best thing that happened all class was when we asked the students to create a basic HTML page with their comments. What they liked / didn't like; what worked / what didn't; We asked for any constructive criticism to help us improve for the next class. It was crazy to read (and translate) some of the feedback from the students (some who came in with ZERO web dev experience).</p><ol><li>I liked the way the class was taught. I liked the first exercise (copying HTML, and then trying to copy the format of another one). For me this was all new to me and i am thankful for the provided tools, especially Notepad++</li><li>I enjoyed the way it was explained (looking at example, copy, then try challenge). It wasn’t too hard for me and i already remembered something that I had seen previously. I learned new commands that I hadn’t used before. I could understand what each elements purpose was, although it was explained pretty fast. It was tough for me to copy the example because it was in English (we told them many times they didn’t need to copy the example HTML word for word 😂)</li><li>The class should be slower, so the whole class learns and understands the content better. It’s necessary to do exercises to practice what we learned. Keep asking us questions about any doubts or problems we have.</li><li>I liked the way that you taught us, part of it was watching what each tag did and then you helped us resolve any doubts/problems we had. You should review each student's work after each section to see how they are doing and what points they should focus on more individually. (what a selfless comment, WOW)</li><li>I have never learned this way / methodology before (lesson, example, hands-on exercise). It was difficult for me because I have never seen anything like this before, but little by little I am going to learn and understand.</li></ol><h2 id="-">🙏</h2><ol><li>Still have some bacterial stomach infection. Need to push through and hope for the best.</li><li>Pray that we get enough teachers for the next part of the class.</li><li>There is so much potential here and I pray that God can use me to help cultivate it. The interest is here, the passion to learn is here, they don't have classes afternoon and now the resources (laptops and internet) are here for them too.</li></ol>
